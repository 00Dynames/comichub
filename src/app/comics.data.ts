	description: "Worried about the situation in which the mutants are, Storm talks with Logan to try and distract herself. In the middle of their conversation, they are interrupted by Forge, who reports that Cerebra detected the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. With most of her team on missions throughout the world, Storm agrees to send Colossus and the team of young mutants he has been training - composed of Anole, Ernst, Glob, and No-Girl - to investigate.Once in Tokyo, Cerebra takes the X-Men to the warehouse from where the mutant signatures were coming only to discover it serves as base for Sugar Man, who proceeds to use his ability to control his own bio-mass to attack Cerebra. Cerebra tells Colossus the mutant signatures are coming from the orb that is on the machine Sugar Man was operating, prompting the villain to reveal it contains mutant embryos he genetically engineered in total isolation from the Terrigen Mists, which he planned to send somewhere safe so he could raise them and become their leader. However, as Sugar Man and Cerebra fight, the machine activates itself and teleports Colossus and his team. Storm and the rest of the X-Men soon arrive and confront Sugar Man. Young Jean Grey uses her powers to discover where Sugar Man sent Colossus and his team, finding out they were sent to the future. Forge reverse engineers Sugar Man's time-travel tech and uses Cerebra to follow them.Arriving a thousand years into Earth's future, the X-Men find Colossus' team, albeit somewhat different. They reveal that they had arrived some time before Storm and her team. When Nightcrawler asks them what became of Colossus, the team is attacked and are shocked to see who attacked them: Colossus and his fellow Horsemen of Apocalypse.",

	description: "Henry 'HANK' McCoy was born and raised in Dunfee, Illinois, the son of Norton and Edna McCoy. His father worked at a nuclear power plant where he was exposed to massive amounts of radiation during an accident. Norton was completely unharmed, but the radiation affected his genes and, as a result, his son was born a mutant. Unlike most mutants, Henry showed signs of mutation from birth:[10] unusually large hands and feet, coupled with unusual strength and agility. A prodigy, Hank was also endowed with an innate superhuman intellect and during adolescence further increased his powers of simian-like augmented agility, reflexes, and strength.[11]",
